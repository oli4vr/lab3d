# lab3d
An ncurses 3d labyrinth demo I made about 20 years ago on a UNIX system.

# Updates
Updated by using nicer UTF-8 based graphics and a map that is revealed as you navigate the maze.

# Gameplay
Solve mazes with increasing difficulty per level. Use the array keys to rotate or move forward. Ctrl+C to quit. Spacebar to use items like food and water. Find and consume water & food or you will die.

# Installation Procedure :
Only prerequisite = libncurses

```bash
apt install -y libncurses-dev
make
make install
```
